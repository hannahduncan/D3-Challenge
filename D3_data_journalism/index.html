          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Poverty</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>As shown in the plot above, as the poverty rate increases, there
            is a corresponding incease in the percent of the population that lacks
            healthcare. This suggests that in the United States, the costs associated with 
            medical visits are not affordable. Alternately, this could mean that 
            certain U.S. populations face a so-called "healthcare desert" and lack access to 
            medical offices, hospitals, and clinics in their region.
          </p>
  
          <p>What do we do about it? Because many of these "healthcare deserts" are 
            located in rural regions of the US, healthcare education systems are encouraging 
            the movement of new doctors, nurses, and radiologists to rural locations. They do
            this by offering early medical school admission and a generous scholarship on the 
            condition that participants spend at least 1 year practicing in a rural area of the US.
